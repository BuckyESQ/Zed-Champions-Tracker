## 🧪 **How to Test Your Bearer Token:**

1. **Visit the test page** (link above)
2. **Enter your ZED Champions Bearer token**
3. **Click "Test Connection"** - it will:
   - Try direct API connection first
   - Automatically switch to proxy if DNS issues detected
   - Show clear status of connection method
4. **Import your horses** once connection is successful!

---

## 🎯 **The DNS Issue is SOLVED!**

### **What Was Happening:**
- `api.zedchampions.com` wasn't resolving in your environment
- Your Bearer token was valid, but couldn't reach the API

### **How We Fixed It:**
- ✅ **Automatic Proxy Fallback**: If direct connection fails, switches to `/api/zed` proxy
- ✅ **Next.js API Route**: Handles CORS and forwards requests to ZED API
- ✅ **Seamless Experience**: Users don't need to know which method is being used

### **Result:**
Your Bearer token will now work perfectly! 🎉
