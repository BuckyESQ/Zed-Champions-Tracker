## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
The AI system integrates seamlessly with existing StableFields data:
- **Horse Data**: Name, bloodline, gender, star ratings, status
- **Race History**: Position, odds, finish times, split times, ZED changes, augment usage
- **Custom Augments**: User-defined augment lists for personalized recommendations

### Core Algorithms

#### Win Probability Calculation
```javascript
// Base probability from historical win rate
// Adjusted for recent form (last 5 races)
// Modified by star ratings (+/- 2% per star above/below 3.0)
// Bloodline multipliers applied
// Range constrained to 5-85%
```

#### Augment Recommendation Engine
```javascript
// Analyzes individual augment performance
// Calculates win rates and average ZED per race
// Recommends best performing combinations
// Confidence based on sample size
```

#### Expected Value Computation
```javascript
// EV = (Win Probability × Average Odds) - 1
// Accounts for risk vs reward
// Expressed as percentage return
```
