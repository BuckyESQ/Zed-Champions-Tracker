### AI Intelligence Capabilities

#### **Smart Augment Recommendations**
```javascript
// Real ZED Champions augment logic with trigger analysis
'Crimson C': { 
    effect: 'Significant Speed boost in the final sprint', 
    condition: 'Final sprint', 
    strength: 0.08, 
    trigger: 'conditional' 
}
```

#### **Breeding Optimization**
```javascript
// Bloodline compatibility matrix for optimal foal prediction
'Nakamoto': { 'Nakamoto': 0.95, 'Szabo': 0.85, 'Finney': 0.90, 'Buterin': 0.80 }
```

#### **Advanced Analytics**
- **Win Probability**: Base rate + recent form + star rating + bloodline modifiers
- **Expected Value**: (Win probability Ã— Average odds) - 1  
- **Readiness Score**: Performance + experience + ROI + star rating
